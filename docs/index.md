# Basic of Total Quality Manangement

Total Quality Management (TQM) is an enhancement to the traditional way of doing business. It is a proven technique to guarantee survival in world-class competition. Only by changing the actions of management  the culture and actions of an entire organization be transformed. TQM is for the most part common sense. Analyzing the three words, we have

- Total: Made up of the whole.
- Quality: Degree of excellence a product or service provides.
- Management: Act, art, or manner of handling, controlling, directing, etc.

Therefore, TQM is the art of managing the whole to achieve excellence.

## Basic Concepts for TQM

TQM requires 6 basic concepts to be understood and implemented. These are:

- Customer Focus
- Continuous Improvement
- Employee Involvement
- Process Approach
- System Approach
- Fact-Based Decision Making

## Quality Definitions

`Q = P / E`
> where Q = quality
> P = performance
> E = expectations

If Q is greater than `1.0`, then the customer has a good feeling about the product or service. Of course, the determination of P and E will most likely be based on perception with the organization determining performance and the customer determining expectations
