# Basic of Total Quality Manangement

Total Quality Management (TQM) is an enhancement to the traditional way of doing business. It is a proven technique to guarantee survival in world-class competition. Only by changing the actions of management  the culture and actions of an entire organization be transformed. TQM is for the most part common sense. Analyzing the three words, we have

- Total: Made up of the whole.
- Quality: Degree of excellence a product or service provides.
- Management: Act, art, or manner of handling, controlling, directing, etc.

Therefore, TQM is the art of managing the whole to achieve excellence.

## Basic Concepts for TQM

TQM requires 6 basic concepts to be understood and implemented. These are:

- Customer Focus
- Continuous Improvement
- Employee Involvement
- Process Approach
- System Approach
- Fact-Based Decision Making

## Quality Definitions

`Q = P / E`
> where Q = quality
> P = performance
> E = expectations

If Q is greater than `1.0`, then the customer has a good feeling about the product or service. Of course, the determination of P and E will most likely be based on perception with the organization determining performance and the customer determining expectations

## Obstrucles to TQM

There are many obstacles to TQM. These include:

- Lack of management commitment
- Inability to change organizational culture
- Lack of Continuous training and education
- Ineffective Measurement Techniques
- Lack of Access to Data and Results
- Lack of Incentives
- Lack of Resources
- Lack of Leadership

## Main Principles of TQM

The main principles that underlie TQM are summarized below:

- Prevention: Prevention is better than cure. In the long run, it is cheaper to stop products defects than trying to find them
- Zero defects : The ultimate aim is no (zero) defects - or exceptionally low defect levels if a product or service is complicated.

- Getting things right first time :  Better not to produce at all than produce something defective

- Quality involves Everyone : Quality is not just the concern of the production or operations department it involves everyone, including marketing, finance and human resources.

- Continuous improvement:  Businesses should always be looking for ways to improve processes to help quality.
- Employee involvement: Those involved in production and operations have a vital role to play in spotting improvement opportunities for quality and in identifying quality problems
