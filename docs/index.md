# Basic of Total Quality Manangement

Total Quality Management (TQM) is an enhancement to the traditional way of doing business. It is a proven technique to guarantee survival in world-class competition. Only by changing the actions of management  the culture and actions of an entire organization be transformed. TQM is for the most part common sense. Analyzing the three words, we have

- Total: Made up of the whole.
- Quality: Degree of excellence a product or service provides.
- Management: Act, art, or manner of handling, controlling, directing, etc.

Therefore, TQM is the art of managing the whole to achieve excellence.

## Basic Concepts for TQM

TQM requires 6 basic concepts to be understood and implemented. These are:

- Customer Focus
- Continuous Improvement
- Employee Involvement
- Process Approach
- System Approach
- Fact-Based Decision Making

## Quality Definitions

`Q = P / E`
> where Q = quality
> P = performance
> E = expectations

If Q is greater than `1.0`, then the customer has a good feeling about the product or service. Of course, the determination of P and E will most likely be based on perception with the organization determining performance and the customer determining expectations

## Obstrucles to TQM

There are many obstacles to TQM. These include:

- Lack of management commitment
- Inability to change organizational culture
- Lack of Continuous training and education
- Ineffective Measurement Techniques
- Lack of Access to Data and Results
- Lack of Incentives
- Lack of Resources
- Lack of Leadership

## Main Principles of TQM

The main principles that underlie TQM are summarized below:

- Prevention: Prevention is better than cure. In the long run, it is cheaper to stop products defects than trying to find them
- Zero defects : The ultimate aim is no (zero) defects - or exceptionally low defect levels if a product or service is complicated.

- Getting things right first time :  Better not to produce at all than produce something defective

- Quality involves Everyone : Quality is not just the concern of the production or operations department it involves everyone, including marketing, finance and human resources.

- Continuous improvement:  Businesses should always be looking for ways to improve processes to help quality.
- Employee involvement: Those involved in production and operations have a vital role to play in spotting improvement opportunities for quality and in identifying quality problems

## Models of TQM

There are many models of TQM. These include:

- Deming's 14 Points

- Juran's Quality Trilogy

- Crosby's 14 Points

- The EFQM Excellence Model

- The Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award

- The ISO 9000 Series

- The Six Sigma Model

- The Lean Model

- The TQM Model

> There are several models of Total Quality Management (TQM) that organizations can use to implement TQM practices. Some of the popular TQM models are:

- Deming's 14 Points: Developed by W. Edwards Deming, this model emphasizes the importance of continuous improvement, customer focus, employee involvement, and leadership in TQM.

- Juran's Trilogy: Developed by Joseph M. Juran, this model includes three components: quality planning, quality control, and quality improvement. It emphasizes the importance of meeting customer needs and expectations and reducing variation in processes.

- Six Sigma: This is a data-driven approach that aims to reduce defects and improve quality by using statistical analysis to identify and eliminate sources of variation in processes.

- ISO 9001: This is an international standard for quality management systems that provides a framework for organizations to implement TQM practices. It includes requirements for processes, documentation, and continuous improvement.

- EFQM Excellence Model: This is a European framework that helps organizations assess their TQM practices across several categories, including leadership, strategy, people, and processes.

## Benefits of TQM

Total Quality Management (TQM) is a comprehensive approach to improving the quality of products, services, and organizational processes. Some of the benefits of implementing TQM practices in an organization are:

- Improved customer satisfaction and loyalty: TQM helps organizations to better understand and meet the needs of their customers. By focusing on customer satisfaction and continuously improving quality, organizations can build customer loyalty and increase customer retention.

- Reduced costs and increased efficiency: TQM emphasizes the elimination of waste, reducing defects, and increasing efficiency in organizational processes. By implementing TQM practices, organizations can reduce costs, improve productivity, and increase profits.

- Better decision-making based on data analysis: TQM emphasizes the use of data and analysis to make informed decisions about organizational processes. By using data to identify areas for improvement, organizations can make better decisions that result in improved quality and increased efficiency.

- Increased employee involvement and motivation: TQM involves all employees in the quality control process, encouraging them to take ownership of their work and contribute to the overall improvement of the organization. This involvement can increase employee motivation and job satisfaction.

- Improved competitiveness and market share: TQM helps organizations to become more competitive by improving the quality of their products and services. By providing high-quality products and services, organizations can increase market share and build a strong reputation for quality.

> In summary, the benefits of TQM are numerous and can lead to improved organizational performance, increased customer satisfaction, and greater organizational efficiency. By implementing TQM practices, organizations can achieve these benefits and remain competitive in their industries.

## JIT

`JIT` stands for `Just-in-Time`, which is a production strategy that involves producing goods or services at the exact time they are needed in the production process, rather than producing them in advance and storing them. JIT aims to minimize waste and inventory costs by producing only what is needed, when it is needed, and in the amount needed.

The JIT approach relies on a tightly coordinated supply chain, where suppliers deliver raw materials and components just in time for production, and finished goods are delivered to customers as soon as they are completed. By minimizing inventory, JIT can reduce the costs associated with storage, handling, and obsolescence, and improve cash flow.

JIT is often associated with lean manufacturing, which aims to eliminate waste and increase efficiency in production processes. JIT has been successfully applied in a variety of industries, including manufacturing, healthcare, and service industries. However, it requires careful planning and coordination to ensure that materials and goods are available when needed and that production processes are optimized for efficiency.

## Khanban System, JIT System and MRP System

*Kanban System:*

The Kanban system is a lean manufacturing system that uses visual signals to trigger the movement of materials, products, or information through the supply chain. It is a pull-based system, where inventory is replenished only when a signal is received indicating that it is needed. Kanban helps to reduce waste, improve efficiency, and increase production flexibility by enabling just-in-time (JIT) delivery.

*MRP (Material Requirements Planning) System:*

Material Requirements Planning (MRP) is a computer-based inventory management system that uses production schedules, inventory levels, and customer orders to determine the amount of materials and supplies needed to meet production requirements. MRP is a push-based system, where materials and supplies are ordered based on forecasted demand and production schedules. MRP helps to ensure that the necessary materials and supplies are available when needed, and can also help to optimize inventory levels and reduce waste.

*JIT (Just-In-Time) System:*

Just-In-Time (JIT) is a lean manufacturing system that focuses on producing goods only when they are needed, in the quantity needed, and at the quality required. JIT is a pull-based system, where inventory is replenished only when it is needed, and production is driven by customer demand. JIT helps to reduce inventory costs, minimize waste, and improve production efficiency by reducing lead times and production cycle times.

*Comparison:*

The main difference between MRP and JIT is that MRP is a push-based system that relies on forecasts and schedules to order materials and supplies, while JIT is a pull-based system that relies on demand to trigger the production and delivery of goods. MRP is better suited for industries with high demand uncertainty, long lead times, and high inventory carrying costs, while JIT is better suited for industries with stable demand, short lead times, and low inventory carrying costs.

On the other hand, the Kanban system is a pull-based system like JIT, but it uses visual signals to trigger the movement of materials, products, or information through the supply chain, whereas JIT relies on demand to trigger production and delivery. The Kanban system is more flexible and adaptable than JIT, and it can be used in a variety of production environments, from manufacturing to service industries.

Overall, each of these systems has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of system depends on the specific needs and characteristics of the business.

## Workers Participation in JIT

*Just-in-Time (JIT)* is a production strategy that relies on producing goods or services at the exact time they are needed in the production process, rather than producing them in advance and storing them. JIT involves close collaboration and communication among all stakeholders, including workers, to ensure that production processes are optimized and waste is minimized.

Worker involvement is crucial to the success of JIT implementation, as it requires a culture of continuous improvement and teamwork to achieve the desired results. Workers need to be involved in every stage of the JIT process, from planning and scheduling to production and quality control.

Here are some ways in which workers can be involved in JIT implementation:

- Cross-functional teams: Workers from different departments and functions can work together in cross-functional teams to identify opportunities for improvement and implement changes in production processes. This can help to break down silos and improve communication and collaboration among workers.

- Quality circles: Workers can form quality circles to identify and solve quality-related problems in production processes. This can help to improve product quality and reduce waste and rework.

- Continuous improvement: Workers can be encouraged to identify opportunities for improvement and suggest ideas for process improvement. This can help to foster a culture of continuous improvement and empower workers to take ownership of their work.

- Training and education: Workers need to be trained and educated on the principles of JIT and how it can benefit the organization. This can help to increase worker buy-in and improve the chances of successful implementation.

> Overall, worker involvement is essential to the success of JIT implementation, as it requires a shift in organizational culture and the adoption of new ways of working. By involving workers in the process, organizations can improve communication and collaboration, reduce waste, improve product quality, and increase efficiency and productivity.
